            The SaYoPillow is designed to address the importance of sleep in our busy lives and promote the idea of
             "Smart-Sleeping." It incorporates an edge processor with a sleep analysis model to monitor physiological 
             changes and sleep habits. Using this data, it predicts stress levels for the next day and securely stores 
             it in the IoT cloud. Data can also be securely transferred to third-party apps. Users have control over 
             data access through a user-friendly interface. This innovative pillow prioritizes sleep patterns to reduce 
             stress, boasting an accuracy rate of up to 96%.
