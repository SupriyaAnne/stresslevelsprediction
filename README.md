### Problem : 

The SaYoPillow is designed to address the importance of sleep in our busy lives and promote the idea of "Smart-Sleeping." It incorporates an edge processor with a sleep analysis model to monitor physiological changes and sleep habits. Using this data, it predicts stress levels for the next day and securely stores it in the IoT cloud. Data can also be securely transferred to third-party apps. Users have control over data access through a user-friendly interface. This innovative pillow prioritizes sleep patterns to reduce stress, boasting an accuracy rate of up to 96%.

### Solution:

This Website will help you to detect a person's stress level during sleep by analysing the values of several features using the Decision Tree Classifier.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can detect the presence of a mental stress or the possible causes of mental ailments due to stress by indicating the highly relevant factors.
